# Masterthesis
Public repo with my masters in Computational Science: Physics at University of Oslo, spring 2023.

The code here is currently provided as-is, with at-best sparse documentation, and no further explanations. This will get better when I finish my thesis, at some point. Then the abstract will be found here, and possibly the entire thesis as well. For now, I wish you good luck.
